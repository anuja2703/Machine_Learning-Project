# Machine_Learning-Project (Movie Recommendation System)
In this Project, We will attempt implementing a few recommendation algorithms (content based, popularity based and collaborative filtering) and try to build an ensemble of these models to come up with our final movie recommendation system.
The Simple Recommender offers generalized recommnendations to every user based on movie popularity . The basic idea behind this recommender is that movies that are more popular and more critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. 
It keeps a track of view counts for each movie/video and then lists movies based on views and ratings.
We are going to use Movies dataset.These files contain metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset.
